#dotfiles

> My dotfiles for UNIX-based operating systems.

Configuration for both `bash` and `zsh` is installed, so you can use whichever shell you'd like.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/mass/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./install.sh
```

If you already have any of the configuration files that this configuration installs, you will be asked if they should be replaced. If you want to keep your old files, enter `n`. If you want to use my configuation files, enter `y`.

Once the script finishes, simply open a new terminal shell to begin using your new configuration!
